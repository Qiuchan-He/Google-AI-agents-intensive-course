This is a crucial area because it's the *how* behind the breakthroughs in drug discovery. It's about the specific types of AI algorithms and models that are enabling these new capabilities.\n\nLet's dive deeper into the most impactful ones:\n\n**1. Generative AI (e.g., Large Language Models - LLMs, Diffusion Models):**\n\n*   **What it is:** Generative AI models are designed to create new content. In the context of drug discovery, this \"content\" can be novel molecular structures, protein sequences, or even synthetic biological data.\n    *   **LLMs:** Originally popularized for text generation (like myself!), LLMs are being adapted to understand and generate sequences – be it DNA, RNA, or even SMILES strings (a way to represent chemical molecules). They can \"learn\" the rules of chemistry and biology to propose new drug-like molecules.\n    *   **Diffusion Models:** These models excel at generating complex data, like images. In drug discovery, they are being used to generate 3D molecular structures with specific shapes and properties, which is critical for how a drug interacts with its target.\n*   **How it's applied in Drug Discovery:**\n    *   **De Novo Molecule Design:** This is the most prominent application. Instead of screening millions of existing compounds, generative AI can design entirely new molecules tailored to a specific disease target. Think of it as creating a custom-fit key for a biological lock.\n    *   **Protein Engineering:** Designing novel proteins or optimizing existing ones for therapeutic purposes.\n    *   **Synthetic Data Generation:** Creating realistic, artificial biological data for training other AI models, especially useful when real-world data is scarce or proprietary.\n    *   **Drug Combination Prediction:** Suggesting optimal combinations of existing drugs for enhanced therapeutic effects.\n\n**2. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs):**\n\n*   **What it is:** GNNs are a type of deep learning specifically designed to work with data represented as graphs. In chemistry, molecules are naturally represented as graphs where atoms are nodes and bonds are edges.\n*   **How it's applied in Drug Discovery:**\n    *   **Predicting Molecular Properties:** GNNs can accurately predict a wide range of properties for a given molecule, such as its solubility, toxicity, binding affinity to a target, and even its synthetic accessibility.\n    *   **Drug-Target Interaction Prediction:** By modeling both the drug molecule and the target protein (also representable as a graph or learned as embeddings), GNNs can predict how strongly they will interact.\n    *   **Drug Discovery Property Optimization:** GNNs can be used in conjunction with generative models to guide the design process, ensuring that the generated molecules have desirable properties.\n    *   **Analyzing Biological Networks:** Beyond molecules, GNNs can analyze complex biological networks (e.g., protein-protein interaction networks) to identify key nodes (potential drug targets) or pathways.\n\n**3. Reinforcement Learning (RL):**\n\n*   **What it is:** RL is a type of machine learning where an \"agent\" learns to make decisions by performing actions in an environment to maximize a cumulative reward. It's like training a robot to play a game.\n*   **How it's applied in Drug Discovery:**\n    *   **Automated Molecule Generation:** RL can be used to \"train\" an AI to generate molecules step-by-step, where each step (adding an atom or bond) contributes to a reward signal (e.g., better binding affinity or desired chemical properties). The AI learns through trial and error to optimize its molecule-building strategy.\n    *   **Optimizing Synthesis Pathways:** RL can be used to design the most efficient and cost-effective chemical synthesis routes for a target molecule.\n    *   **Adaptive Experimental Design:** Guiding laboratory experiments to yield the most informative data for further AI model refinement.\n\n**Why these advances are significant:**\n\n*   **Moving Beyond Screening:** These techniques allow us to *design* molecules with desired properties rather than just searching through existing ones. This is a fundamental shift.\n*   **Increased Speed and Efficiency:** By making more accurate predictions early on, these AI techniques drastically reduce the time and cost associated with identifying promising drug candidates.\n*   **Tackling Complex Diseases:** They provide powerful tools to understand and target diseases with complex biological mechanisms, where traditional approaches might have failed.\n*   **Unlocking New Chemical Space:** Generative AI can explore vast regions of chemical possibility that have never been synthesized or tested before.\n\nThe synergy between these AI techniques is also key. Often, a generative model will propose candidate molecules, and a GNN will evaluate their properties, with RL potentially guiding the iterative refinement of both. This combination of methods is accelerating the pace of innovation in drug discovery dramatically.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  The landscape of companies involved in AI-driven drug discovery is dynamic and diverse, spanning established pharmaceutical giants, dedicated AI biotech startups, and major tech companies with healthcare divisions.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the key players, categorized for clarity:\n\n**1.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom `SlidingWindowCompactor` and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
